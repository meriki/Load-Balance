# We will be creating a host for running Consul alone. It will not be a part of the swarm. So we can create a host named consul first.
# 
docker-machine create \
  -d vmwarefusion \
  consul


# To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env consul
docker-machine env consul

# Run this command to configure your shell: 
eval $(docker-machine env consul)
